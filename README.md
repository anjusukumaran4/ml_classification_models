# ML  Classification Models
Machine Learning is the field of study that gives computers the capability to learn without being explicitly programmed. ML is one of the most exciting technologies that one would have ever come across. As it is evident from the name, it gives the computer that makes it more similar to humans: The ability to learn. Machine learning is actively being used today, perhaps in many more places than one would expect.Classification is a process of categorizing data or objects into predefined classes or categories based on their features or attributes. In machine learning, classification is a type of supervised learning technique where an algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset to predict the class or category of new, unseen data. There are mainly two type of classification

🔸 Binary Classification: In binary classification, the goal is to classify the input into one of two classes or categories. Example – On the basis of the given health conditions of a person, we have to determine whether the person has a certain disease or not.

🔸 Multiclass Classification: In multi-class classification, the goal is to classify the input into one of several classes or categories. For Example – On the basis of data about different species of flowers, we have to determine which specie our observation belongs to.
There are various types of classifiers.Some of them are

❄️ Linear Classifiers: 

Linear models create a linear decision boundary between classes. They are simple and computationally efficient. Some of the linear classification models are as follows: 

🔸 Logistic Regression

🔸 Support Vector Machines having kernel = ‘linear’

🔸 Single-layer Perceptron

🔸 Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) Classifier

❄️ Non-linear Classifiers:

Non-linear models create a non-linear decision boundary between classes. They can capture more complex relationships between the input features and the target variable. Some of the non-linear classification models are as follows: 

🔸 K-Nearest Neighbours

🔸 Kernel SVM

🔸 Naive Bayes

🔸 Decision Tree Classification

🔸 Ensemble learning classifiers:  Random Forests, AdaBoost etc

🔸 Multi-layer Artificial Neural Networks
